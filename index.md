#### UOS Surveys

At the University of Sydney, Unit of Study surveys are sent out twice a semester to help academic staff to improve their teaching.

For the sake of transparency, I try share all my survey results publically along with my responses, with the exception of surveys with less than 5 particpants. 

**Semester 1 2022**
- S1 Mid
- S1 End

**Semester 2 2022**
- S2 Mid
- S2 End

I also occasionally conduct anonomous surveys of my classes outside of these period where I feel nessesary, and may release those if I find anything interesting.
