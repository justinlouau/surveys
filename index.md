#### UOS Surveys

At the University of Sydney, Unit of Study surveys are sent out twice a semester to help academic staff to improve their teaching.

Since I've started teaching in 2022, I try share all my survey results publicly, alongside any comments or follow up in response to feedback.

**Semester 1 2022**
- [Freeform Feedback](/surveys/S1_Freeform.pdf)
- [Statistical Feedback](/surveys/S1_Ratings.pdf)

**Semester 2 2022**
- *Coming Soon*

I also occasionally conduct anonymous surveys of my classes outside of official survey periods where I feel necessary, and may release those if I find anything interesting.
