<!-- #### UOS Surveys -->

At the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), student surveys are sent out twice a semester (weeks 6 and 12) to help academic staff to improve their teaching.

Since I've started tutoring in 2022, I try share all my survey results publicly, alongside any comments or follow up in response to feedback.

Once I have time, I plan on putting together some reflections and anecdotes from this data as a potential resource for myself and others. I also collect feedback outside of official survey periods, which I might also release if I find anything interesting.
