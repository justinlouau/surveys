<!-- #### UOS Surveys -->

At the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), student surveys are sent out twice a semester (weeks 6 and 12) to help academic staff to improve their teaching.

Since I've started tutoring in 2022, I try share all my survey results publicly, alongside any comments or follow up in response to feedback.

I also collect feedback outside of outside of official survey periods, and may release responses or changes relating to those if I find anything interesting. 

Once I have time, I plan on putting together some resources to breakdown different teaching strategies and tutorial structures I've tried, and their impact in relation to my feedback results as a way to continually improve my teaching and as a potencial resource for other tutors and the broader community.
